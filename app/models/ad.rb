  def summary
    # fixme: There are a bunch of ways this can be improved. There might
    # be some gems for it already. For instance, end only at sentence
    # breaks and allow small overflows when close to full length.
    # Also, stick 240 in config somewhere?
    # Also, better whitespace / split / paragraph detection
